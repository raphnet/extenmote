-v2.1.1
 - Add a new button mapping. (Enabled with L+R+Z+Joystick_down)
 - Improve joystick analog range in "high res" mode.
 - N64: ZL and ZR are not longer tied. By default, only ZL is pushed. The old
 combined behavior can be toggled with L+R+Z+Joystick_up.

-v2.1.0
 - Add new classic controller reporting modes (Fixes the NES Classic Edition)

-v2.0.0
 - Add support for Megadrive and SMS controllers
 - Compilation fix for new AVR LIBC (Atmega168a vs. Atmega168 sleep registers)

-v1.9.7
 L/R analogic sliders fix and improvements:
   - N64/SNES: Simulate full L/R analogic deflection when L/R are pressed.
   - Gamecube: Fix L/R analog sliders support (broken since 1.9!)

-v1.9.6
 - Fix NES/SNES controller support (was broken in v1.9.5)

-v1.9.5
 - New Gamecube button mapping
 - Triple click on START button now triggers the HOME button (SNES/NES/GC/N64)
 - Prevent a 8 bit overflow from occuring with some cheap controller clones.
   Fixes the "joystick left/down direction does not work" problem, but keep
   in mind the overall quality of the controller won't increase. It will
   work as bad as it does on a real N64.
 - Fix N64/Gamecube communication timing
 - Fix eeprom init bug (Last mapping not saved)
 - Improved controller auto-detection

-v1.9 -- Improved raw data feature
 - Added raw data for SNES and NES controllers
 - Implemented a special mode where the extension ID changes with the
   connected controller.
 - Modified GC/N64 raw data feature to includes the button data too and
   to be exactly in the format received from the controller.
Technical details here: http://www.raphnet.net/programmation/extenmote_raw/index_en.php

-v1.8
 - [GC/N64] Raw analog data and a signature is now appended to the standard
   classic controller report structure. Software that is aware of this
   will be able to use the full resolution of the original joysticks.

-v1.7
 - [GC] Added a gamecube mappings (for Devolution)
 - [GC] Added a gamecube button combination to trigger the home button (A+B+Y+X+Z+C-Down)
 - [GC] Implemented gamecube L and R sliders
 - [GC/N64] Holding start when connecting the controller (or powering up)
   disables the button mapping combos for the session.

-v1.6
 - Add two N64 mappings for F-Zero X and Yoshi's Story
 - Add a tool I use for QA (Requires Linux and a wusbmote adapter)
 - The N64 Default curve (1.5) was not really active by default. L+R+Z+A had
   to be explicitely pressed. (now fixed)
 - Fix calibartion data for libOGC (Fixes wii64 and probably others)
 - N64: When mapping 0 is active, pressing the four C buttons + Dpad left + Z
   sends X+Y pressed status (for wii64 menu)

-v1.5
 - New v1.5 default curve (much better in Zelda)
 - When switching from the Wii menu to a game, the adapter does not
   have to be reconnected anymore.
 - Fixed the 'always scrolling' bug that occured in the Wii U main menu (Wii
   menu was ok)
 - Removed the old v1.1 curve

-v1.4.1
 - Use the configured N64 curve for real

-v1.4
 - Implemented a better Gamecube conversion curves
 - Added two gamecube mappings
 - Two N64 transfer curves now available (the default works better with
 normally worn controllers)\
 - The adapter now remembers and restores the last settings that have been
 used.

-v1.3
 - Implemented a new gamecube mapping to help SNES games
 - Finished Gamecube C stick implementation.
 (Gamecube L/R analog part still not implemented. I need a game
 that uses it to test)

-v1.2
 - PORTD4 must be kept high for low power consumption on builds using the
 multiuse PCB2:
 (http://www.raphnet.net/electronique/multiuse_pcb2/index_en.php)

-v1.1
 - Use a reverse lookup table for the N64 to VC transfer function

-v1.0

Supported:
 - N64 support with 6 mappings
 - SNES support with 3 mappings: Tested SNS-005
 - NES controller support: Tested Standard controllers (NES-004), NES MAX (NES-027)
 - Tested with several NES, SNES and N64 virtual console titles as well as
   Mario Kart Wii.

Known issues:
 - Some NES controllers won't work due to the 3.3v supply
   (ex: NES Advantage)
 - Gamecube support incomplete (missing analogic L/R sliders)
